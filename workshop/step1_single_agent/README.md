# Step 1: Single Agent Critic

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**Goal:** Build the simplest working agent and prove the framework works

## What You'll Learn

- How to create an `OpenAIChatClient`
- How to create a `ChatAgent` with instructions
- How to run an agent with `.run()`
- What an agent response looks like

## Key Concepts

> **"An Agent is a specialized LLM with instructions and optional tools."**

This is the smallest working unit in the Microsoft Agent Framework. We start with one role: **Critic**.

## Run This Step

```bash
cd workshop/step1_single_agent
python agentcon_demo.py
```

## Expected Output

You should see:
1. ✅ The input architecture (deliberately flawed)
2. ✅ A critique with bullet points identifying problems

## What's Happening

1. **Client Creation** - `OpenAIChatClient` connects to OpenAI API
2. **Agent Creation** - `ChatAgent` wraps the client with role-specific instructions
3. **Execution** - `.run()` sends the message and gets a response
4. **Result** - `response.text` contains the agent's output

## Next Step

➡️ **Step 2**: Add a second agent (Fixer) to create a sequential pipeline
